1. Overview
A simple and clean QR Code Component built with pure HTML and CSS. The goal of this challenge was to create a responsive and visually appealing QR code card that matches the design provided by Frontend Mentor.

4. My process
Built with

a. Semantic HTML5 markup

b. CSS custom properties

c. Flexbox for layout

d. Mobile-first workflow

5. What I learned

Through this project, I reinforced my understanding of CSS Flexbox for centering elements both vertically and horizontally.
I also practiced creating visually balanced components with proper spacing, alignment, and font sizing.

Here are a few key parts of the code I’m proud of:

body {

  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
 
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;

  display: flex;

  align-items: center;
 
  justify-content: center;
 
  height: 100vh;
}

.main {
 
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);

  width: 300px;

  padding: 45px 15px;
 
  border-radius: 13px;
 
  display: flex;
  
  flex-direction: column;
  
  align-items: center;
}

img {
  
  width: 225px;
  
  height: 225px;
  
  border-radius: 13px;
}


This structure allowed me to neatly center the QR code and text while keeping everything responsive and simple.

6. Continued development

-In future projects, I’d like to:

-Explore CSS Grid for alternative layout options

-Implement hover animations or transitions for interactive effects

-Practice structuring projects with reusable CSS classes and variables
